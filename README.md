# KeywordPing

![Inbox](https://i.imgur.com/R2Rz9gw.png)

Get notified when messages match your keywords. Uses Discord's native notification system, so it looks and sounds just like a regular @mention.

*When a keyword matches, you're added to the message's mentions. Discord handles the rest.*

## Features

- Uses native Discord notifications
- Lightweight and simple
- Whole word matching (so "cat" won't trigger on "category")
- Supports regex for advanced patterns
- Filter keywords by user, channel, or server
- Whitelist or ignore specific users
